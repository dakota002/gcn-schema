  "description": "A simple example schema that can be used as boilerplate for new missions. As a new producer, you should copy this file and the `alert.example.json` file into a new folder for your mission, update the `$id` field to reflect this new file path, and update the title to name it appropriately for your mission. You may then expand on the `properties` and `allOf` fields to further develop your new schema. You must also update the `$schema` field in the `alert.example.json` file to match the newly updated `$id` field in the schema file so that the validator knows what to validate against.",
